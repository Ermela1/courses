# **Python Lecture 1**

# Different levels of coding language
* From low to high:
  * Logic gates
    * Example: AND gate
  * Assembly
    * Example: Roller Coaster Tycoon
  * Compiled C
    * Human readable, also optimizes automatically
  * Scripting language
    * Example: Python (more readable, more convenient, but slower)
    *          Pearl
    *          Ruby

# Base Objects
* Non-iterable 
  * Integers
    * Example: 27
  * Floats
    * Example: 3.41
* Iterable
  * Strings (not mutable)
    * Example: "apple"
  * Tuple (not mutable)
    * Example: (27, 3.41, 'apple')
  * List (mutable)
    * Example: [27, 3.41, ‘apple’]
  * Dict (mutable)
    * Example: {27: 'a'
                3.41: 7
                'apple':[1,2]}
    * NOTE: Dict is an associative list that is made up of key-value pairs
    * Example: Key= dog, value= definition

# Dynamic Typing
* a=7 (integer)
* Note: you are assigning the integer 7 to 'a'
* When you type 'a' into python, it will be defined as 7
* 'a' can also be a string, float, etc.

# Operator
* Function that acts on objects
* Examples:
  * +
    * Example: a= 1+2=3
    *          a= "western"+"university"= "westernuniversity"
  *  *
    * Example: a=3*4=12
    *          a= "bird"*3= 'birdbirdbird'

# Python is a Zero-based Index
* What does this mean?
* Let's use this example to explain:
  * a= "apple"
  * a[0]...'a'
  * a[3]...'l'
  * a[0:2]...'ap'
  * a[1:-1]... 'ppl'
