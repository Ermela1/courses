# Computational Pathology

# What is computational pathology?
* It can be defined in a few ways
  * Using raw data to aide diagnosis of patients
    * Electronic medical records
    * Laboratory data
    * Radiology/pathology imaging
  * Data can be used to derive biologically and clinically applicable findings
  * Using mathematical models to produce inferences and predictions about diagnosis 
  * Overall, using computational methods to improve health care 

# When can computational pathology be utilized?
*	Advanced determination of disease possibility
* Disease trends in populations
* Cost-benefit analysis of treatment in the health care system
* For creating jobs in data-related research in the health care system
* Using computational methods when determining the optimal selection of patients in clinical trials 

# What kind of impact does computational pathology have on research?
* Creating algorithms used for diagnosing disease
* More appropriate selection of therapy
* Aides in prediction of patient outcomes
* In case of cancer analysis:
  * Databases can be made containing cancer genetics, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenetics, glcomics and exposomes
  * Tumor and stromal architectures
  * Immune interactions in cancer cases

# Physiological and pathological population dynamics of circulataing human red blood cells
## Overview
* Made use of the hospital clinical lab and statistical physics to establish a master equation model for red blood cell maturation and clearance
* The model can be used to identify patients with anemia and can be used to discern iron-deficiency anemia from thalassemia-trait anemia (having smaller than normal red blood cells, resulting in anemia)
* The model can also determine patients that may be anemic several weeks before the anemia can be detectable
* This study is a prime example of how we can use clinical laboratory data to perform a direct test on human pathophysiology
