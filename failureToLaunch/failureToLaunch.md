# HIV genotyping is standard of care

* Generate the genetic sequence of a patient's HIV infection
* Examine sequence for mutations that confer drug resistance
* Optimize patient's drug regimen in response to virus evolution
* Significantly improves clinical outcomes!



# BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS

</center>

* A CAP accredited clinical laboratory for HIV genotyping.
* BC Drug Treatment Program - fully subsidized clinical testing and treatment for all residents of BC living with HIV
* A population database with clinical, demographic and genetic data for nearly 9,000 patients. 
* Over 30,000 HIV resistance genotypes

# Sanger sequencing

* Dye-terminator sequencing with capillary electrophoresis.
* A decades-old workhorse of the modern lab.
* Ambiguous base calls can reproducibly detect minority HIV species (>25%)



# Next-generation sequencing

* Run millions of sequencing reactions at the same time!
* Development of new sequencing chemistry, highly specialized instruments.
* Roche/454 became dominant in field of HIV because of longer read lengths.



# The promise of NGS for HIV

* Detection of minority HIV variants
* More cost-effective whole-genome sequencing?
* Reconstructing the evolution of HIV within patients
