# Viruses matter

* Not classified as "alive" (no metabolism, no translation)
* Viruses evolve
* Have significant impact on the fitness of organisms
* Have signifcant impact on the environments of living things

# Origin of viruses

* Progressive hypothesis:  viruses evolved from mobile genetic elements

* Regressive hypothesis:  viruses descended from intracellular parasites

* Virus-first hypothesis:  viruses are a basal lineage from an RNA world ancestor

# Viruses do not have a "Tree of Life"

* There is no genetic homology across all viruses like 16S rRNA

* Without homology, it is not possible to construct a single tree relating all viruses

* Virus diversity organised by "morphology"
